📚🏋 Led a team of 4 people to build a member recognition project using RFID Sensor for Technovit . Our project reads the Unique ID of each RFID tag we place close to the reader and displays it on the attached OLED display. If the UID of the tag is equal to a predefined value stored in the Arduino’s memory, then “Already a Member” message is displayed on the OLED. If the UID of the card does not match the stored value, it displays the QR code of our club's Instagram page so that students can get access to valuable information.
